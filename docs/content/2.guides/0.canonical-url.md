description: Ensure a canonical URL is set to avoid duplicate content issues.

## Introduction

It's common to have multiple URLs pointing to the same content. For example,
supporting a `www.` and non-`www.` domain or misc-matched trailing slashes.

The "main" domain is called the canonical URL. Ensuring a single canonical URL helps avoid [duplicate content issues](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/66359?hl=en)
and confusion for end-users.

## Canonical Head Tag

Nuxt SEO automatically sets a canonical URL meta tag for you. This tag is generated from the site URL and the current route path.

```html
<head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/my-page" />
</head>
```

### canonicalQueryWhitelist

The canonical URL is generated from:
- `site.url`. Your [Site Config](/docs/site-config/getting-started/introduction) url.
- `$route.path`: The current route path.
- `canonicalQueryWhitelist`: A list of query parameters that should be included in the canonical URL.

By default, the `canonicalQueryWhitelist` includes a number of common query parameters that will modify the page content:

- `page`
- `sort`
- `filter`
- `search`
- `q`
- `query`

You can override this by providing your own list of query parameters that should be included in the canonical URL.

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  seo: {
    canonicalQueryWhitelist: ['myCustomQuery']
  }
})
```

## Redirect To Canonical

In some cases it may be preferred to redirect all non-canonical URLs to the canonical URL.

This redirect is optional and disabled by default.

```ts twoslash [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  seo: {
    redirectToCanonicalSiteUrl: true
  }
})
```
