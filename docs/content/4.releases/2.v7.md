description: Release notes for v7.0.0 of Nuxt SEO Utils.

## Introduction

The v7 major includes improved defaults for safer canonical URLs, improved breadcrumb usage and
support for automatic icon creation.

## Nuxt Version Requirement

Nuxt SEO Utils v7 requires Nuxt v3.16 or later.

Please upgrade your Nuxt version using `nuxi upgrade --force`.

## Lowercase Canonical URLs [#41](https://github.com/harlan-zw/nuxt-seo-utils/pull/41)

Lowercases the canonical URLs to avoid duplicate content issues when displaying URLs that may have different capitalization.

### :icon{name="i-noto-warning"} Breaking Changes

If you have URLs that are intentionally cased then this may lead to some issues, it's recommended to disable canonicalLowercase.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  seo: {
    canonicalLowercase: false
  }
})
```

## Shared Breadcrumb Context

If you were previously generating multiple breadcrumb lists on the same page without specifying an `id`,
you will now run into issues with context being shared between the components.

This is intentional as previously you would be rendering invalid Schema.org markup.

To fix this you should specify an `id` which will have shared context.

```ts
useBreadcrumbItems({
  id: 'my-breadcrumb',
})
```

### :icon{name="i-noto-warning"} Breaking Changes

If you have multiple breadcrumbs on your page please verify this new logic
doesn't cause them to conflict.

If they do make sure you are setting a unique `id` for each one.
