## :icon{name="i-noto-warning"} Breaking Changes

### Shared Breadcrumb Context

If you were previously rendering multiple `<Breadcrumb>` components on the same page without specifying an `id`,
you will now run into issues with context being shared between the components.

This is intentional as previously you would be rendering invalid Schema.org markup.

To fix this you should specify an `id` which will have shared context.

```ts
useBreadcrumbItems({
  id: 'my-breadcrumb',
})
```
